![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/kevinwang09/learningtower/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)


The goal of learningtower is to provide a user-friendly R package to provide easy access to a subset of variables from PISA data collected from the [OECD](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/), for years 2000 - 2018, collected on a three year basis.

**What is PISA?**

The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an international assessment measuring student performance in reading, mathematical and scientific literacy.

PISA assesses the extent to which 15-year-old students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in society, and how well they are prepared for lifelong learning in the areas of reading, mathematical and scientific literacy.

In 2018, PISA involved 79 countries and 600,000+ students worldwide. 

Read more about the Programme [here](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/).


## Installation

You can install the development version of `learningtower` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kevinwang09/learningtower")
```

## Usage

The PISA assessment measures responses from individual students and school principals. A subset of features of these questionnaires can be found in `student` and `school` respectively (the latter coming soon). As an example, we can load the `student` data as follows:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(learningtower)
data(student)
head(student)
```

See `?student` for information pertaining to variables captured.

We can get further information on the schools and country codes in the `school` and `countrycode` data, respectively.

```{r}
data(school)
head(school)

data(countrycode)
head(countrycode)
```


## Exploring the data 

Changing the scales over-highlights differences in the means between various countries.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
library(gganimate)
library(learningtower)

s <- student %>% 
  filter(country == "SGP" | country == "CAN"| country == "FIN" | country == "NZL" | country == "USA" | country == "JPN" | country == "GBR" | country == "AUS") %>% 
  group_by(year, country) %>%
  summarise(math = weighted.mean(math, stu_wgt, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=math, group=country, color = country)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()+
  ylim(c(250,800)) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Score") +
  xlab("Year")+
  theme(text = element_text(size=20)) +
  ggtitle("Mathematics PISA Scores from 2000 - 2018") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  view_zoom_manual(pause_length = 1,
                   step_length = 10, 
                   xmin = c(2000, 2018),
                   xmax = c(2000, 2018),
                   ymin =c(200, 450),
                   ymax = c(800, 600),
                   wrap = FALSE,
                   fixed_x = TRUE)

gif <- animate(s, 
               device = "png",
                type="cairo",
                units="in", 
                width=9, 
                height=6, 
                pointsize=24, 
                res=200)

```
